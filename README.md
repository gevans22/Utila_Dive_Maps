Utila Dive Maps
===============

A web application exploring use of dive site data from Utila, Honduras with the Express.JS framework

Uses the Express framework for user management and database calls for each map page.

The application uses CartoDB, a web-based PostGIS mapping engine, for its database of dive sites and shops. <br /> <br />
Each map page uses SQL calls to pull up the appropriate GeoJSONs for the dive shops and dive sites and then maps them using leaflet.js.
